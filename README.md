## Introduction
In this practical we will briefly discuss about chess benefits on school. 
## Content
Playing chess as most of its benefits on math learning. But several research showed that you need to have a chess teacher rather than a mathteacher to teach chess at school. Indeed, by playing chess you can learn patterns and mecanisms to solve problems and with this knowledge you increase your math performances. Ask me if you want more details !
## Conclusion
That was only a brief teasing of what chess could create on you. I hope you are a bit more interested on the topic. I wrote an article about it and can give more information if you want, don't hesitate.
