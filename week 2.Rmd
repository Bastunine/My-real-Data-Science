Welcome in my first Data Practical. I'm Bastien Nespolo and will explain my research during the reports that I write. I let you discover my work and I wish you to have a great moment!


1. Introduction
2. Content
3. Conclusion

## Introduction

In this practical we will briefly discuss about chess benefits on school. 

## Content
Playing chess has most of its benefits on math learning. But several research showed that you need to have a chess teacher rather than a math teacher to teach chess at school. Indeed, by playing chess you can learn patterns and mechanisms to solve problems and with this knowledge you increase your math performances. Ask me if you want more details !

## Conclusion
That was only a brief teasing of what chess could create on you. I hope you are a bit more interested on the topic. I wrote an article about it and can give more information if you want, don't hesitate.

## Bibliography
That's my first and only bibliography so I'll just explain how I did during my following reports. Each time that I used a new references I added it on this report. So here you can find all my bibliography for each report. Packages that I used are also present here.

Here you can find some interesting articles about what I'm talking on this report:
